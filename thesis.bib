abstract = {We present thermodynamic and transport properties of transition-metal (T) arsenides, TAs, with T=Sc to Ni (3d), Zr, Nb, Ru (4d), Hf and Ta (5d). Characterization of these binaries is carried out with powder x-ray diffraction, temperature-and field-dependent magnetization and resistivity, temperature-dependent heat capacity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. All binaries show metallic behavior except TaAs and RuAs. TaAs, NbAs, ScAs and ZrAs are diamagnetic, while CoAs, VAs, TiAs, NiAs and RuAs show approximately Pauli paramagnetic behavior. FeAs and CrAs undergo antiferromagnetic ordering below T                          N 71K and T                          N 260K, respectively. MnAs is a ferromagnet below T                          C 317K and undergoes hexagonal-orthorhombic-hexagonal transitions at T                          S 317K and 384K, respectively. For TAs, Seebeck coefficients vary between +40 and 40$\mu$V K                          1  in the 2-300K range, whereas thermal conductivity values stay below 18Wm                          1 K                          1 .

abstract = {The linear magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is often used to probe magnetism of ferromagnetic materials, but MOKE cannot be applied to collinear antiferromagnets (AFs) due to the cancellation of sub-lattice magnetization. Magneto-optical constants that are quadratic in magnetization, however, provide an approach for studying AFs on picosecond time scales. Here, we combine transient measurements of optical reflectivity and birefringence to study the linear optical response of Fe{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}As to small ultrafast temperature excursions. We performed temperature dependent pump-probe measurements on crystallographically isotropic (001) and anisotropic (010) faces of Fe{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}As bulk crystals. We find the largest optical signals arise from changes in the index of refraction along the {\$}z{\$}-axis, i.e. perpendicular to the N$\backslash$'eel vector. Both real and imaginary parts of the time-resolved optical birefringence rotation signal approximately follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic heat capacity, as expected if the changes in dielectric constants are dominated by contributions of exchange interactions to the dielectric constant. We conclude that under our experimental conditions, changes in the exchange interaction contribute more strongly to the temperature dependence of the magneto-optic constants than the Voigt effect.},

abstract = {The single crystal of RuAs obtained by Bi-flux method shows obvious successive metal-insulator transitions at T{\_}MI1{\~{}}255 K and T{\_}MI2{\~{}}195{\$} K. The X-ray diffraction measurement reveals a formation of superlattice of 3x3x3 of the original unit cell below T{\_}MI2, accompanied by a change of the crystal system from the orthorhombic structure to the monoclinic one. Simple dimerization of the Ru ions is nor seen in the ground state. The multiple As sites observed in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrum also demonstrate the formation of the superlattice in the ground state, which is clarified to be nonmagnetic. The divergence in 1/T{\_}1 at T{\_}MI1 shows that a symmetry lowering by the metal-insulator transition is accompanied by strong critical fluctuations of some degrees of freedom. Using the structural parameters in the insulating state, the first principle calculation reproduces successfully the reasonable size of nuclear quadrupole frequencies for the multiple As sites, ensuring the high validity of the structural parameters. The calculation also gives a remarkable suppression in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, although the gap opening is insufficient. A coupled modulation of the calculated Ru d electron numbers and the crystal structure proposes a formation of charge density wave (CDW) in RuAs. Some lacking factors remain, but it shows that a lifting of degeneracy protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry through the superlattice formation is a key ingredient for the metal-insulator transition in RuAs.},

abstract = {We report the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiperovskite Mn{\$}{\_}{\{}3{\}}{\$}NiN with substantial doping of Cu on the Ni site (i.e. Mn{\$}{\_}{\{}3{\}}{\$}Ni{\$}{\_}{\{}1-x{\}}{\$}Cu{\$}{\_}{\{}x{\}}{\$}N), which stabilizes a noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order compatible with the AHE. Observed on both sintered polycrystalline pieces and single crystalline films, the AHE does not scale with the net magnetization, contrary to the conventional ferromagnetic case. The existence of the AHE is explained through symmetry analysis based on the {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 4g{\}}{\$} AFM order in Cu doped Mn{\$}{\_}{\{}3{\}}{\$}NiN. DFT calculations of the intrinsic contribution to the AHE reveal the non-vanishing Berry curvature in momentum space due to the noncollinear magnetic order. Combined with other attractive properties, antiperovskite Mn{\$}{\_}{\{}3{\}}{\$}AN system offers great potential in AFM spintronics.},

abstract = {Magnetotransport measurements of ferromagnetic MnAs epilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy reveal the presence of both positive and negative charge carriers. Electrical transport at high temperatures is dominated by holes and at low temperatures by electrons. We also observe distinct changes in the magnetoresistance associated with the transition between the electron- and hole-dominated transport regimes. These results are of direct relevance to MnAs/semiconductor hybrid heterostructures and their exploitation in electronic and optical spin injection experiments. {\textcopyright} 2001 The American Physical Society.},
